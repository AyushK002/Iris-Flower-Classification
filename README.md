This is a very popular project in the field of Machine Learning.
The goal of this project is to classify the flowers in the three species â€“ virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.

To achieve this task, I have used the K-nearest neighbours algorithm, beacuase it was the easiest approach for this problem.
KNN works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number examples
(K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label (in the case of classification) or averages the labels (in 
the case of regression).

(This project was originally built as a submission project for Cognitive Applications Workshop.)
